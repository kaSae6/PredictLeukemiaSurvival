# Dataset Characteristics

## Overview

In this milestone, you are required to explore and analyze the dataset you are using for your project. Understanding your dataset is a critical component of any machine learning project.  
Utilize statistical graphics, plots, and information tables to summarize the dataset's main characteristics.

## Challenge Data 

The challenge, along with the datasets were provided by QRT in partnership with Institut Gustave Roussy with real data from 24 clinical centers and aims to contribute to a meaningful  application of data science in the medical field. 
The provided datasets include 3,323 patients for training and 1,193 patients for testing purposes, each with one set of clinical and molecular data. The unique patient identifier (ID) column links the different datasets.
It's the goal of the challenge to predict the overall survival (OS) for patients diagnosed with blood cancer.
